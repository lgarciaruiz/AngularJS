The hash # that is used as the href in the anchor tag is reffered to as a fragment identifier. It identifies a fragment of the page

- Hash change is an event and you can keep track of it changing with the window.addEventListener('hashchange', function(){
    console.log('has is ' + window.location.hash)
})

-- THE ANCHOR/ID DOES NOT HAVE TO EXIST FOR THE HASH CHANGE TO KEEP TRACK OF IT AND THE LOCATION TRACKING TO WORK

This helps mimic as if you were going out and getting a new url. This makes it feel and behave like a native desktop application. 

Keeping track of the hashchange will allow you to make ajax calls and go out and get the new page without having to actually reload a new page.
