- $location is the service used for the hash location
- the hash location is found at $location.path()

--Angular-route (ngRoute) helps in building SinglePageApplications SPAs
    - ngRoute provides routing and deeplinking services and directives for SPAs based on the location.path()

- the service $routeProvider makes it easy to setup the routing for when the hash is set to specific value
    -$routeProvider is passed in to the config() method
    -when passed in you will use the .when() method which takes in a string and an object
        - the string is the hashlocation it should look for
        - the object details where to look for the page to display and the controller to connect to this page
            - the object uses: 
                - templateUrl: location of html folder to display
                - controller: name of controller to assign to this page

- When using the $routeProvider you do not need to specify the ng-controller directive in the html
- Only use the ng-view directive and the entire div will be replaced with the contents of the templateUrl
